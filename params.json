  "body": "# DetecteurViolaJones\r\nProject in C++ where we implement a Viola-Jones face recognition detector\r\n\r\n**Keywords**: Viola-Jones, face recognition, Haar features, AdaBoost, classifiers.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nThe objective of this project is to implement a Viola Jones face recognition system.\r\nFor that we have used the open library `CImg` to load the images. At the end we have implemented a \r\nrobust classifier wich is used to distinguish faces and non faces. The results can be found in the directory Rapport (in french)\r\nand the Scripts in C++ in the directory Scripts.\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\nJusts clone the github repo. It is required to have [ImageMagik](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php) \r\ninstalled in order to use the CImg library. To run the codes just do one of:\r\n\r\n\tmake test_q_1_1 # test the integral image\r\n\tmake testEps # test for epsilon and K (see raport)\r\n\tmake main # test the viola-jones algorithm\r\n\tmake clean # clean extra files\r\n##References\r\n[1] Yoav Freund and Robert E.
